# myCMS
This project started as a simple, lightweight CMS built in PHP for my own personal use. It was created out of a practical need — to have a fast, minimal, and fully controllable system without unnecessary complexity.

Over time, the project evolved. It became more stable, more structured, and more flexible. And now, instead of keeping it private, I’ve decided to make it public.

I believe software should be open, transparent, and useful beyond its original purpose. If this CMS can save someone time, help launch a project, or serve as a learning reference — then sharing it is worth it.
